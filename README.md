# RPG Store in Java
This project is an implementation of an RPG store in Java, using the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm. The store offers a variety of products related to items that would typically be found in role-playing games, such as armor, weapons, potions, and accessories. Each item can increase various stats, including Health, Armor, Speed, Damage, and Magic. You can buy and sell the items you collect at a lower price, and you start with 5500 credits.
